Question :      
In a previous challenge you implemented the Insertion Sort algorithm. It is a simple sorting algorithm that works well with small or mostly sorted data. However, it takes a long time to sort large unsorted data. To see why, we will analyze its running time.

Explanation:
The running time of an algorithm for a specific input depends on the number of operations executed. The greater the number of operations, the longer the running time of an algorithm. We usually want to know how many operations an algorithm will execute in proportion to the size of its input. 

So in this, the program I simply count how many swaps this algorithm takes for sorting the entire array and return this count variable.

Example:

Input:  5
        2 1 3 1 2

Output: 4
