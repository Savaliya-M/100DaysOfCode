Question :

create one counter method and make this method synchronize and then call this method from different threads five times.

Explanation:

While we use synchronize a method and call this method from a different thread then still it executes this thread in a synchronous way.

In this program, I created one class synchronized thread which has one synchronized counter method in this method simply increment the I by one. Also, I create two other class thread 1 and thread 2 in this both class I implements the run method and in this run method, I simply call the counter method five-time.

In the main method, I create objects of thread 1 and thread 2 and then I create two threads and pass the object.

Example

Output: 1
        2
        3
        4
        5
        1
        2
        3
        4
        5
