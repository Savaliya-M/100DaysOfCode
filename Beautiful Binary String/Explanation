Question :     
Alice has a binary string. She thinks a binary string is beautiful if and only if it doesn't contain the 
substring "010".

In one step, Alice can change a 0 to a 1 or vice versa. Count and print the minimum number of steps needed to 
make Alice see the string as beautiful.

Explanation:
In This program, First I convert the input string into a character array and then I take one for loop which starts from the second character and goes up to the last character. In this loop, I compare the i-1th character with 0, an ith character with 1, and the i+1th character with 0. If this condition not satisfies then I increment the count and at last, I return the count. 

Test Cases :
1) If string contains the string value.

Example:

Input:  7
        0101010
Output: 2
