📌 Question :   

HackerLand University has the following grading policy:

📍 Every student receives a grade in the inclusive range from 0 to 100.

📍 Any grade less than 40 is a failing grade.

Sam is a professor at the university and likes to round each student's grade  according to these rules:

📍 If the difference between the grade and the next multiple of 5 is less than 3, round the grade up to the next multiple of 5.

📍 If the value of the grade is less than 38, no rounding occurs as the result will still be a failing grade.

📌 Explanation:

In this program, I take one for each loop in this loop in this loop first I check grade is greater than or equal to 38. if the condition is satisfied then I check if 5 minus grade mod 5 is less than 3 if yes then I add 5 minus grade mod 5 to the grade and add it to the list else I simply add the grade. if the first condition does not satisfy then also I add the grade to the list without updating it. At last, I return the list.

📌 Example:

📌 Input:

4
73
67
38
33

📌 Output:

75
67
40
33
