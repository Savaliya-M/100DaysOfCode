Question :

James found a love letter that his friend Harry has written to his girlfriend. James is a prankster, so he decides to meddle with the letter. He changes all the words in the letter into palindromes.

--To do this, he follows two rules:

1) He can only reduce the value of a letter by 1, i.e. he can change d to c, but he cannot change c to d or d to b.
2) The letter a may not be reduced any further.

Each reduction in the value of any letter is counted as a single operation. Find the minimum number of operations required to convert a given string into a palindrome.

Explanation:

In this program, Simply we take one for loop which runs half of the string length time. Because we compare first character with last character. In this for loop we just substract the last character from first character and whatever result will come we take absoult value of it. And add it to count. At last we return the count. 

Test Cases :

1) if the String contains a characters only.

Example:

Input:  4
        abc
        abcba
        abcd
        cba

Output: 2
        0
        4
        2
