Question :     
Watson gives Sherlock an array of integers. His challenge is to find an element of the array such that the sum of all 
elements to the left is equal to the sum of all elements to the right.

Explanation:

In this program, First I calculate the sum of all elements in the array. Then I take one for each loop that runs for all 
elements in the array and check 2 * x is equal to sum - y. Here initially x = 0 and y is the ith element. 

If this above condition satisfies then I return "YES" else I simply add y into x. Last, if the above condition does not 
execute then I will return the "NO".

Test Cases :

1) if array length is 1

Example:

Input:  3
5
1 1 4 1 1
4
2 0 0 0
4
0 0 2 0 

Output: YES
        YES
        YES
