ðŸ“Œ Question :   

The city of Gridland is represented as an n x m matrix where the rows are numbered from 1 to n and the columns are numbered from 1 to m.

Gridland has a network of train tracks that always run in straight horizontal lines along a row. In other words, the start and end points of a train track are (r, C1) and (r, C2), where r represents the row number, C1 represents the starting column, and C2 represents the ending column of the train track.

The mayor of Gridland is surveying the city to determine the number of locations where lampposts can be placed. A lamppost can be placed in any cell that is not occupied by a train track.

Given a map of Gridland and its k train tracks, find and print the number of cells where the mayor can place lampposts.

Note: A train track may overlap other train tracks within the same row.

ðŸ“Œ Explanation:

In this program, First I check if k equals 0. if the condition is satisfied then I return the n * m because all cells are empty. else I create one map in that map I stores the information of track and pass row number as the key. while storing the information first check if the key is already available if yes then first I will update the value of the start and end accordingly like the merged track of both the track. 

After that, I will iterate through the map and a minus number of cells from the total cell which is not empty. And at the end, I return the total.

ðŸ“Œ Example:
ðŸ“Œ Input:
4 4 3
2 2 3
3 1 4
4 4 4

ðŸ“Œ Output:
9
