Question :

Reduce a string of lowercase characters in range ascii[‘a’..’z’]by doing a series of operations. In each operation, select a pair of adjacent letters that match, and delete them.

Delete as many characters as possible using this method and return the resulting string. If the final string is empty, return the Empty String

Explanation:

In this program, First, I create one StringBuilder and pass the input string to it. and then I take one for a loop which starts from the second character and goes up to the last character. in this loop, I compare the ith character with the i-1th character if it is equal then I remove these characters from the StringBuilder and reset my I to 0.

After that, I simply store the remaining character of StringBuilder to Resultant String, and then I check if the length of Resultant string is equal to 0 if yes then I return "Empty String" or else I return resultant string.

Test Cases :

1) if the string contains any special character or digit.

Example: 

Input: aaabccddd

Output: abd
