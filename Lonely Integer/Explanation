Question :   

Given an array of integers, where all elements but one occur twice, find the unique element.

Explanation:

In this program, First I create on hashmap. After that I take one for each loop in this loop I check if the map contains a particular key. If this condition satisfies then I simply increment its value by one. else I put this key and set its value as 1. 

After that, I take another for each loop. In this loop, I check if the value of the particular key is equal to 1. If this condition satisfies then I return that particular key.

Test cases :

1) if the unique value is more then one.

Example:

Input: 9
       4 9 95 93 57 4 57 93 9

Output:  95
