Question :

To lock the door he needs a key that is an anagram of a palindrome. He starts to go through his box of strings, checking to see if they can be rearranged into a palindrome. Given a string, determine if it can be rearranged into a palindrome. Return the string YES or NO.

Explanation:

In this program, I first count the occurrence of the character in the string, and accordingly, I increment the value in the char count array. after doing this I count if an odd count occurs more than one time if yes then I am not able to transform this string into palindrome so I return the "NO" else I return the "YES".

Test Cases :

1) if the String contains special characters.

Example:

Input: aaabbbb

Output: YES
