Question :

Julius Caesar protected his confidential information by encrypting it using a cipher. Caesar's cipher shifts each letter by a number of letters. If the shift takes you past the end of the alphabet, just rotate back to the front of the alphabet. In the case of a rotation by 3, w, x, y and z would map to z, a, b and c.

Explanation:

In this program, we take two parameter strings and how much rotation the user wants. if the user wants more than 26 rotations then we first convert this number in the range of 1-26. after that, we take one for loop which runs for each character of the string. now we check if the character arrived in uppercase if it is the upper case then we first add k to the character then if this new character is greater than 90 (90 is the Z) then we convert it into a range between 65 to 90. After that, we simply add this new character into the resultant string.

The same we do for lowercase and if other characters arrived rather than the alphabet then remains it as it is. And, At last, we return the resultant string.

Test Cases :

1) if the string doesn't contain alphabets.

Example:

Input: middle-Outz  2

Output: okffng-Qwvb
