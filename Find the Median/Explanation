Question :      
The median of a list of numbers is essentially its middle element after sorting. The same number of elements occur after it as before. Given a list of numbers with an odd number of elements, find the median?

Explanation:
In this program, I have to find the middle element after sorting. For that as input, I received one unsorted list of elements of integer type.

First I sort all the elements in ascending order and then I find the middle element for that I simply divide the size of list-1 by 2 and store it in the mid variable. At last, I simply return the element which is present in the midst index.

Test case :
1) if input list with even number of element.

Example:

Input:  7
        0 1 2 4 6 5 3

Output: 3
