Question :

create two classes even and odd and using the Runnable interface create a thread and then call both classes 
using an appropriate method.

Explanation:

Why do we use the Runnable interface even if we can implement multithreading by extending the thread class?

--> Because using the Runnable interface we can implement multiple inheritance.

    In this program, I create two classes even and odd that implement a Runnable interface in this class I print 
the first five even or odd numbers and I implement this logic of even and odd in the run method of the 
interface.

    Also, I create another class in which I first create the object of even and odd class, and then I create two 
object of thread class and pass the object of even and odd class as parameter, and then I set the priority of 
that object means thread. I give min priority to the even class, and then I call the start method using the 
object name. This start method then calls the run method of both classes.

    while executing the program it will run the odd class first and then the even class because I gave the min 
priority to the even class.

Example

Output: odd
        1
        3
        5
        7
        9
        even
        2
        4
        6
        8
        10
