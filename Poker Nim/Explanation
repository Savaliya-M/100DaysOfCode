Question :   

The rules of the games are as follows:

- The game starts with n piles of chips indexed from 0 to n-1. Each pile i (where 0<=i<n) has ci chips.

- The players move in alternating turns. During each move, the current player must perform either of the following actions:

     - Remove one or more chips from a single pile.

     - Add one or more chips to a single pile.

At least 1 chip must be added or removed during each turn.

- To ensure that the game ends in finite time, a player cannot add chips to any pile i more than k times.

- The player who removes the last chip wins the game.

Given the values of n, k, and the numbers of chips in each of the n piles, determine whether the person who wins the game is the first or second person to move. Assume both players move optimally.

Explanation:

In this program, There are piles with chips player has to either remove or add one or more chips from the piles. Players can add chips to the piles k times. who moves the chips, at last, will win the game. for that in this program I apply the logic of xor first I take for each loop and count the xor of all chips. At last, I check if xor is equal to 0 if the condition is satisfied then I return "Second" else I return "First".

Example:

Input:  2
        2 5
        1 2
        3 5
        2 1 3

Output: First
        Second
