Question :     
Sort the element using Radix sort.

Explanation:

First, we find the maximum element from the array and store it in a max variable. Then I take one for loop which runs till the how many digits in the max number. for each Place m and place, we call the counting sort function and pass array, n, and place.

Now I create one counting sort function. In this I store digit means a unit, tens or hundreds as provided in the parameter to the max. Then I take one more for loop which starts from 1 and goes up to n.

In this loop, I check if arr[i]/place%10 > max if this condition satisfies then I assign this digit as the max digit. and then I initialize all elements of the count array as 0. Then I count of occurrence of the particular digit. 

After that, we find the cumulative sum of that array and update all values as a cumulative sum. After that, I take one for loop which starts from the last index and goes up to the first index. In this loop, I store ith element to output array of count[arrr[i]/place % 10-1]th position. Now I increment the value of Count[arr[i]/place%10] by one. and then I update the value arr as an output array.


Test Cases :

1) if inputted array has the wrong type of element

Example:

Input: 5 
       65 23 1 89 4 

Output: 1 4 23 65 89
