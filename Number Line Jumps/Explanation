📌 Question :   

You are choreographing a circus show with various animals. For one act, you are given two kangaroos on a number line ready to jump in the positive direction (i.e, toward positive infinity).

📍 The first kangaroo starts at location x1 and moves at a rate of v1 meters per jump.

📍 The second kangaroo starts at location x2 and moves at a rate of v2 meters per jump.

You have to figure out a way to get both kangaroos at the same location at the same time as part of the show. If it is possible, return YES, otherwise return NO.

📌 Explanation:

In this program first I check if the position of kangaroo 1 is less than position of kangaroo 2. then I check steps of kangaroo1 are also lesser than or equal to the steps of kangaroo 2 If yes then I return "NO". else I take one while loop in which the position of kangaroo 1 is lesser than or equal to the position of kangaroo 2. In this loop, I check the position of both kangaroos is equal. if the condition is satisfied then I return "YES". else I increment both positions to steps. at last, if no one condition satisfies the I return  "NO". Same I do if the position of kangaroo two is less than kangaroo 1

📌 Example:
📌 Input:

0 2 5 3

📌 Output:

NO
