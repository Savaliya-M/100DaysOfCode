ðŸ“Œ Question :

Given an amount and the denominations of coins available, determine how many ways change can be made for the amount. There is a limitless supply of each coin type.

ðŸ“Œ Explanation:

In this program, First I create one Array of n+1 size and after that, I assign 1 to 0th position. Then I take two nested for loops. In which the outer for loop runs for the coins list and the inner for loop starts from coins of the ith element to n+1. In this for loop, I assign j-coins of the ith element of numcoins array to the jth position of the nums array. At last, I return the numscoins array of the nth element.
