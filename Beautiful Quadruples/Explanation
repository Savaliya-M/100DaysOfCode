📌 Question :   

We call an quadruple of positive integers,(W,X,Y,Z) , beautiful if the following condition is true:

W^X^Y^Z != 0 

Given A, B, C, and D, count the number of beautiful quadruples of the form (W,X,Y,Z) where the following constraints hold:

📍 1<=W<=A
📍 1<=X<=B
📍 1<=Y<=C
📍 1<=Z<=D

When you count the number of beautiful quadruples, you should consider two quadruples as the same if the following are true:

📍 They contain the same integers.

📍 Number of times each integers occur in the quadruple is same.

📌 Explanation:

In this program, First I store all values in one array and then I sort the array. After that, I take two nested loops for the last two numbers. In this loop first I calculate ai^bi and then I store this value if not present else update its value by incrementing by one in the map and incrementing the count by one. 

Now same I do for the first two digits but the only difference is in the inner loop I check for w is lesser than or equal to a minimum of arr of 0 or x. After that, I take one for loop for removing duplicate pairs from the count. At last, I return the count.
