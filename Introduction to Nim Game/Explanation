Question :   

Nim is the most famous two-player algorithm game. The basic rules for this game are as follows:

- The game starts with a number of piles of stones. The number of stones in each pile may not be equal.

- The players alternately pick up 1 or more stones from 1 pile

- The player to remove the last stone wins.

Explanation:

In this program, I apply the logic of xor if x xor stone is equal to 0 then always player Second will win else always player First will win. So for that in this program first I create x with an initial value of 0. After that, I take one for each loop calculating x^stones. after that, I check if the value of x equals 0 then I return "Second" else I return "First".

Example:

Input:  2
        2
        1 1
        3
        2 1 4

Output: Second
        First
