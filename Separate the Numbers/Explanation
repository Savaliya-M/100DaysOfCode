Question :

Perform q queries where each query consists of some integer string s. For each query, print whether or not the string is beautiful on a new line. If it is beautiful, print YES x, where x is the first number of the increasing sequence. If there are multiple such values of x, choose the smallest. Otherwise, print NO.

Explanation:

In this program, first, I take one for loop and I iterate this for loop for half of the length of string time. This loop is useful for making a pair of numbers. after that I make a substring of a number according to i means first I make a substring of one number then I make a substring of two numbers. then I assume it is a valid string.

After that, I take one while loop which generates the incremented sequence of numbers. after that, I compare this incremented sequence with input if it matches then I update the valid to 1. And at last, I check if valid is equal to 1 if yes then I print "YES" and the first number of the sequence. else I print "NO".

Test Cases :

1) if the string contains 0 before the number.

Example:

Input:  4
        99910001001
        7891011
        9899100 
        999100010001

Output: YES 999
        YES 7
        YES 98
        NO
