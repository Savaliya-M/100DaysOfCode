Question :

create two classes even and odd and using the thread class give the max priority to the odd class object and 
min priority to the event class object and then call both classes using an appropriate method of the thread 
class.

Explanation:

In this program, I create two classes that extend the thread class even and odd in this in this class I print
the first five even or odd numbers I implement this logic of even and odd in the run method of the thread
class. 

Also, I create another class in which I first create the object of even and odd class, and then I set the
priority of that object means thread. I give max priority to the odd class and min priority to the even class 
and then I class the start method using the object name this start method calls the run method of both classes. 

while executing the program will run the odd class first and then the even class because I gave the max 
priority to the odd class.

Example: 
Output: odd
        1
        3
        5
        7
        9
        even
        2
        4
        6
        8
        10
