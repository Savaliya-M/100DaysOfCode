Question :   

Two people are playing the game of Mis√®re Nim. The basic rules for this game are as follows:

- The game starts with n piles of stones indexed from 0 to n-1. Each pile i(where 0<=i<n) has si stones.

- The players move in alternating turns. During each move, the current player must remove one or more stones from a single pile.

- The player who removes the last stone loses the game.

Given the value of n and the number of stones in each pile, determine whether the person who wins the game is the first or second person to move. If the first player to move wins, print First on a new line; otherwise, print Second. Assume both players move optimally.

Explanation:

In this program, I apply the logic of xor if x xor stone is equal to 0 then always player Second will win else always player First will win. But one special case is also there which is if all piles have one stone then if piles are even then the First will win else the Second will win.

 So for that in this program first I take one for loop and count how many piles have only one stone after that I check if the count of piles is even if this condition satisfies then I return "First" else I return "Second". After that, I create x with an initial value of 0. After that, I take one for each loop calculating x^stones. after that, I check if the value of x equals 0 then I return "Second" else I return "First".

Example:

Input:  3
        2
        1 1
        3
        2 1 3
        6
        9 8 4 4 4 7

Output: First
        Second
        First
