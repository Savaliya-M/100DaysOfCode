Question :     
Two friends like to pool their money and go to the ice cream parlor. They always choose two distinct flavors and they 
spend all of their money.

Given a list of prices for the flavors of ice cream, select the two that will cost all of the money they have.

Explanation:

In this program, first I take one for loop which starts from the first element and goes up to the last element. In this 
loop for each iteration, I calculate m - x and store it in y. where m is the total money they have and x is the ith 
element. 

Now I fetch this y from the map and store it into j. If I get this y from the map then I simply store j+1 and i+1 into 
the resultant list. If this y is not present in the map then I store this element as a key and its index as the value in 
the map. And at last, I return this resultant list.

Test Cases :

1) if the sum of any two number will not equal to m

Example:

Input:  2
        4
        5
        1 4 5 3 2
        4
        4
        2 2 4 3 

Output: 1 4
        1 2
