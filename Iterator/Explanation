Question :

Create a method func. The method takes an ArrayList as input. In that ArrayList there are one or more integer 
numbers, then there is a special string "###", after that there are one or more other strings. So the other 
strings after "###" you have to print.

Explanation:

In this program, I create one function which takes the ArrayList as input and then first creates an iterator 
for mylist ArrayList after that I take one while loop which runs until the ArrayList has any value in it.

In this while loop, I create an object for a current item of ArrayList and then I check if the current element 
is an instance of a string if this condition satisfies then I break the while loop and return the it.
and then in the main method, I display the remaining list.

Test cases :

1) if the "###" is not in the list

Example

Input: 2 2
        42
        10
        hello
        java

Output: hello
        java
