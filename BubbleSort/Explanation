* Sorting using bubble sort

Explanation: 

    In the bubble sort algorithm, it checks the first two elements if the first element is greater than then the second element 
then it swaps the element and this process will run till the length of the array.

    In bubble sort, after the first iteration, we get the largest element at the last position.

Test Cases:

1) If all elements of an array are the same
2) if the user wrong type of data



Example

Input: [5, 6, 7, 8, 4]

Output: [4, 5, 6, 7, 8]
