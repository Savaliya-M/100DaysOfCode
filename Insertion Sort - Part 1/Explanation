Question :      
One common task for computers is to sort data. For example, people might want to see all their files on a 
computer sorted by size. Since sorting is a simple problem with many different possible solutions, it is often 
used to introduce the study of algorithms.

Explanation:
In this program, first, I take one for loop which starts from the second element and goes up to the last 
element in this loop I take the ith element as the key. Then I create one variable j and assign it to i-1. 
After that, I take one while loop which checks j >= 0, and the jth element is greater than the key if yes then 
I swap this element with the j+1th element and decrement the j by one.

After that, I print the array and then I update the value of j+1 with the key. And At last, again I print the 
array.

Example:

Input:  5
        2 4 6 8 3

Output: 2 4 6 8 8
        2 4 6 6 8
        2 4 4 6 8
        2 3 4 6 8
