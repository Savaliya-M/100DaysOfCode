Question :     
Sort the element using Bubble sort.

Explanation:

In this program, first I take one for loop which starts from the first element and goes up to the last element. In this loop, I take one nested for loop which starts from the last element and goes up to the i+1th element. And in this loop, I check if an array of the jth element is lesser than the array of the j-1th element. If this condition satisfies then I swap both elements. 

In this algorithm, we get 0 to i as a sorted element after each iteration.

Test Cases :

1) if inputted array has the wrong type of element

Example:

Input: 5 
       65 23 1 89 4 

Output: 1 4 23 65 89
