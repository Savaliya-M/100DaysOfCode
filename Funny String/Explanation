Question :    

In this challenge, you will determine whether a string is funny or not. To determine whether a string is funny,
create a copy of the string in reverse e.g. abc -> cba. Iterating through each string, compare the absolute 
difference in the ASCII values of the characters at positions 0 and 1, 1 and 2, and so on to the end. If the 
list of absolute differences is the same for both strings, they are funny.

Determine whether a given string is funny. If it is, return Funny, otherwise, return Not Funny.

Explanation:

In this program, first I convert the string int character array and then create an integer array for storing 
the difference value. After that, I take one for loop which starts from the first character and goes up to the 
second last character of the string. In this for loop simply calculate the difference between the ith character 
and the i+1th character and store it in an arr array.

After that again I take one for loop which starts from the first element of the arr array and goes up to 
length/2 th element Because in this loop we compare our first element with the last element and the second 
element with the second last element and so on. if it not satisfy then I simply return "Not Funny". In the 
end, if the above condition not satisfies then I return the "Funny String".

Test Cases :

1) if the String contains a digit.

Example:

Input: 2
        acxz
        bcxz

Output: Funny
        Not Funny
