Question :

Amanda has a string of lowercase letters that she wants to copy to a new string. She can perform the following operations with the given costs. She can perform them any number of times to construct a new string P:
--Append a character to the end of string P at a cost of 1 dollar.
--Choose any substring of P and append it to the end of P at no charge.

Explanation:

In this program, First, we create two variables String p and int count. After that, I take one for loop which runs for every character of the string. in this for loop First I take one String variable ch and store the ith character in it. 

After that, we check if that character is present in the p String if it is not present then we increment the count variable and append this character to the and of the P String. At last, I return the count variable.

Test Cases :

1) if the String contains null characters.

Example:

Input:  2
        abcd
        abab

Output: 4
        2
