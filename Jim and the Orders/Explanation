Question :   

Jim's Burgers has a line of hungry customers. Orders vary in the time it takes to prepare them. Determine the order the customers receive their orders. Start by numbering each of the customers from 1 to n, front of the line to the back. You will then be given an order number and a preparation time for each customer.

The time of delivery is calculated as the sum of the order number and the preparation time. If two orders are delivered at the same time, assume they are delivered in ascending customer number orders.

Explanation:

Here, in this program first I create the hashmap and then I take one for loop which iterates for the size of the orders list. In this loop, I calculate the sum of the order number and preparation time. and put this sum as a key and i+1 as a value in the hashmap. After that, I create one treemap and pass this hash map as an argument. Because

in a treemap, all keys are sorted.

After that, I put all values into the resultant list and then return that map.

Test cases :

1) if the sum of all orders are same

Example:

Input: 3
1 3
2 3
3 3

Output: 1 2 3
