ðŸ“Œ Question :

Your goal is to find the number of ways to construct an array such that consecutive positions contain different values.

Specifically, we want to construct an array with n elements such that each element between 1 and k, is inclusive. We also want the first and last elements of the array to be 1 and x.

Given n, k, and x, find the number of ways to construct such an array. Since the answer may be large, only find it modulo 10^9+7.

ðŸ“Œ Explanation:

In this program first I create two arrays a and b of size n After that if the k value is 1 then I assign the 0th element of a array as 1 else 0. and the opposite on array b. After that, I take one for loop which I assign an i-1th element of b in a of i-1, and also in b of i-1th position I apply one formula to find how many possible arrays can be formed which doesn't have x as a last element. At last, I return the n-1th element of array a.
