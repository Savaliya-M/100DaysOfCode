Question :   

Two players are playing a game of Tower Breakers! Player 1 always moves first, and both players always play optimally. The rules of the game are as follows:

- Initially there are n towers.

- Each tower is of height m.

- The players move in alternating turns.

- In each turn, a player can choose a tower of height x and reduce its height to y, where 1<= y < x and y evenly divides x.

- If the current player is unable to make a move, they lose the game.

    Given the values of n and m, determine which player will win. If the first player wins, return 1. Otherwise, return 2.

Explanation:

In this program If there is an even number of towers there always player 2 will wins same as if the height of the tower is 1 then also player 2 will always win. In all other cases, player 1 will wins. so simply in this program first I check if the number of towers is even or height of the tower is 1. If this condition satisfies then I simply return 2 else I return 1.

Example:

Input: 2
       2 2
       1 4

Output: 2
        1
