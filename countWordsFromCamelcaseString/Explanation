Question :- count words from the camelCase String.

Explanation:

        In this program, we first convert the string into a character array and after that, we take one for
loop and check if the ith element of the array is capital if the condition is true then we increment the count
by one and after all iterations, we return count+1 because in camel case string first word the first character
is not capital.

Test Cases:
1) if the string is not in camel case

Example

Input: saveChangesInTheEditor
Output: 5
Number of words in the string: 5
