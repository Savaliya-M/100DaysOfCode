Question :   

Mark and Jane are very happy after having their first child. Their son loves toys, so Mark wants to buy some. There are a number of different toys lying in front of him, tagged with their prices. Mark has only a certain amount to spend, and he wants to maximize the number of toys he buys with this money. Given a list of toy prices and an amount to spend, determine the maximum number of gifts he can buy.

Note Each toy can be purchased only once.

Explanation:

In this program first I sort the list in ascending order. Then I take one while loop in that loop and put the condition as the sum variable is lesser than the k variable. In this loop, I add an ith element to the sum. and assign I in the count variable. Then I increment i by one. and after that, I return the count variable.

Test cases :

1) what if the money he has is not enough to get at least one toy?

Example:

Input: 4 7
        1 2 3 4

Output: 3
