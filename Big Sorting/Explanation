Question :     after sorting 
Consider an array of numeric strings where each string is a positive number with anywhere from  to  digits. 
Sort the array's elements in non-decreasing, or ascending order of their integer values and return the sorted 
array.

Explanation:
In this program, I use different methods to sort elements because there are some constraints like string may 
of 10^6. Of course, we can solve it by any of the sorting techniques but in that method may be the time 
complexity gets it bit higher. 

So Here, First I use the sort method of the Collection class and pass the inputted list as well as alone with 
I implements the compare method of the collection class and pass as an argument in that method simply I compare
two String length because if the length of one string is greater than means that number is also bigger.

So, I simply return 1 if the length of a is greater, -1 if the length of a is lesser and if both string is as 
the same length then I compare those two strings using the compareTo method in this if a is greater than it 
returns 1, if lesser than it returns -1 and equal than it returns the 0. At last I return the Inputted list 
because now it's sorted.

Test Cases :
1) If string contains the character value.

Example:

Input:  6
        31415926535897932384626433832795
        1
        3
        10
        3
        5
Output: 1
        3
        3
        5
        10
        31415926535897932384626433832795
