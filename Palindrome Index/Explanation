Question :

Given a string of lowercase letters in the range ascii[a-z], determine the index of a character that can be removed to make the string a palindrome. There may be more than one solution, but any will do. If the word is already a palindrome or there is no solution, return -1. Otherwise, return the index of a character to remove.

Explanation:

        In this program, I take one for loop which runs length of string / 2 times because in this loop I compare the first character with the last character of the string. If it not matches then I create one substring from where it doesn't match and call one function palindrome check and pass this string to that function.

        In this second function simply check if this passed string is palindrome or not if it is palindrome then I return true else I return false. and in the first function, I store the response of this function's boolean variable, and then I check if this function returns true or false if it returns true then I return i because by removing the ith character from the string, String becomes a palindrome else I return s.length()-i-1 which means by removing this character string becomes a palindrome. If the whole string is already the palindrome then I return -1.

Test Cases :

1) if the String contains a number.

Example:

Input:  3
        aaab
        baa
        aaa

Output: 3
        0
        -1
