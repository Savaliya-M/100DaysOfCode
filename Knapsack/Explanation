ðŸ“Œ Question :

Given an array of integers and a target sum, determine the sum nearest to but not exceeding the target that can be created. To create the sum, use any element of your array zero or more times.

ðŸ“Œ Explanation:

In this program, I first create a boolean array of size k+1. Then, I take two nested for loops. In the inner loop, I check if the jth element of the sack array is true. If it is, I break the loop. If it is not, I check if j minus the pth element of weights is greater than 0 and j minus the pth element of weights is true. If it is, I assign true to the jth element of the sack. After that, I check from the last element in the sack array. If I find true anywhere, I print i and return from the for loop. If I do not find true anywhere, I print 0 at the end.

ðŸ“Œ Example:

ðŸ“Œ Input:

3 12
1 6 9
5 9
3 4 4 4 8

ðŸ“Œ Output:

12
9
