📌 Question :   

We define the super digit of an integer x using the following rules:

Given an integer, we need to find the super digit of the integer.

📍 If x has only 1 digit, then its super digit is x.

📍 Otherwise, the super digit of x is equal to the super digit of the sum of the digits of x.

📌 Explanation:

In this program, I have to find the super sum of the given number. For that as input I will receive the number and k means I have to concatenate the same number k time and after that, I have to find the super sum.

For that, I find the super sum of the inputted number and after that, I multiplied with k then if the result will be lesser than 9 then this is our answer if it is not then I have to find the super sum of the multiplied value and whichever digit I get it is our answer.

📌 Example:

📌 Input:  9875 4

📌 Output:  8
