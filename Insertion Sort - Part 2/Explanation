Question :      
In Insertion Sort Part 1, you inserted one element into an array at its correct sorted position. Using the same approach repeatedly, can you sort an entire array?

Guideline: You already can place an element into a sorted array. How can you use that code to build up a sorted array, one element at a time? Note that in the first step, when you consider an array with just the first element, it is already sorted since there's nothing to compare it to.

Explanation:
In this program, first, I take one for loop which starts from the second element and goes up to the last 
element in this loop I take the ith element as the key. Then I create one variable j and assign it to i-1. 
After that, I take one while loop which checks j >= 0, and the jth element is greater than the key if yes then 
I swap this element with the j+1th element and decrement the j by one.

After that, I update the value of j+1th element with the key. And At last, I print the array After each iteration.

Example:

Input:  6
        1 4 3 5 6 2

Output: 1 4 3 5 6 2
        1 3 4 5 6 2
        1 3 4 5 6 2
        1 3 4 5 6 2
        1 2 3 4 5 6
