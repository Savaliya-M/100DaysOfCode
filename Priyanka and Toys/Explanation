Question :      
Priyanka works for an international toy company that ships by container. Her task is to the determine the lowest cost way to combine her orders for shipping. She has a list of item weights. The shipping company has a requirement that all items loaded in a container must weigh less than or equal to 4 units plus the weight of the minimum weight item. All items meeting that requirement will be shipped in one container.

What is the smallest number of containers that can be contracted to ship the items based on the given list of weights?

Explanation:

In this program first I sort the list of weights in ascending order. After that, I take one count variable which counts the container needed and initialize it with 1. after that I stored the first item into s. Because after sorting the minimum item is available at the first position. 

After that I take one for each loop in this loop I check if a > s+4 if yes then I increment the count of containers by one and also update the s value as a. At last, I return the count variable.

Test cases :

1) if the all item weight is greater than the weight of the minimum weight item + 4.

Example:

Input:  8
        1 2 3 21 7 12 14 21

Output: 4
